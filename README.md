# QuickDynalist

Quick Dynalist is an independent open-source client for [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) (an enhanced [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/)).
Its focus is on providing rapid access to any part of your Dynalist database via shortcuts, widgets, and other deep integrations into Android.
New items should be added with as little overhead as possible to make Dynalist a true extension to your brain.
We also provide an extremly responsive native experience optimized for the Android platform.
